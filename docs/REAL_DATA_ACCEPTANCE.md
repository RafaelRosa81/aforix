# Real-data acceptance campaign

This campaign validates Aforix function-by-function with real source data while keeping generated acceptance outputs isolated from the normal working database.

## Isolation

- Real RAW inputs remain in `data/raw` and are treated as read-only.
- Acceptance runs: `runs_acceptance/`
- Acceptance database: `database_acceptance/`
- Acceptance exports: `outputs_acceptance/`
- Main acceptance config: `configs/examples/acceptance_real.yaml`

## Acceptance sequence

1. Baseline inventory of real RAW files.
2. `config-check`.
3. Ingest: FlowTracker, Molinete, Nivus.
4. `build-groups`.
5. `normalize run`.
6. Technical audit + `validate run`.
7. Exports.
8. External-source converters.
9. Analyses.
10. Batch orchestration.
11. Separate review of placeholders/legacy commands.

## Result states

- PASS: verified correct against real source data or an independently calculated expectation.
- WARN: function works, with a known limitation or data condition.
- FAIL: incorrect result; add a regression test before fixing.
- NOT IMPLEMENTED: command exists but the underlying function is still a placeholder.

## Baseline inventory

Run from repository root:

```powershell
python .\scripts\acceptance_inventory.py
```

This writes SHA-256-based physical inventory files under `runs_acceptance/_inventory` without modifying RAW inputs.
